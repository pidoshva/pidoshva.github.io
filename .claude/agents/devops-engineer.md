Updated `.claude/agents/devops-engineer.md` with the following changes:

- **Added skills:** `github-pages`, `hugo` — the two most relevant skills for this agent's deployment and static site management responsibilities
- **Kept tools scoped:** Only `context7` MCP tools are included (not Excalidraw, Slack, or Linear, which aren't relevant to DevOps tasks for this project)
- **System prompt:** Retained the well-customized project-specific content covering deployment architecture, CNAME management, CSS hash coordination, GitHub Actions conventions, and critical rules
