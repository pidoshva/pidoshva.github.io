          <h4>Objects</h4>
            <p>Game: Implemented</p>
            <p>playerShips: Implemented</p>
            <p>computerShips: Implemented but needs work to randomly generate placement of ships. Ship placement is currently hard coded.</p>
            <p>playerGuesses: Not Implemented</p>

          <h4>Arrays</h4>
            <p>Ship arrays are implemented and stored in the playerShips and computerShips Objects. The player's ship arrays are determined by the player choosing a starting cell
               and direction and are then stored in the playerShips object. I plan on writing a function that will randomly place the computer's ship arrays but it hasn't been
               implemented yet.

                be placed on the board. (I still need to implement boundary checks.)</p>
