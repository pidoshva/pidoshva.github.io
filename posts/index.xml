      <description>Currently working on a facial recognition project that is supposed to use a dataset of known faces for recognition and capture unknown faces adding them to the dataset for later training. I&amp;rsquo;m using an OpenCV library to implement all the features.
This is the next project I will be posting.</description>

      <description>Just uploaded my Online Groceries project structure and implementation description. Once again, the project was inspired by UVU project which required me to write invoice.py script.
I worked on design of reverse program order.py.
Here I described the structure of data storage and implementation of order.py as well as invoice.py.</description>

      <description>Currently working on &amp;ldquo;Online Groceries&amp;rdquo; program inspired by UVU class. The idea is to collect items with customer information as you would do when shopping online and create a structure for storage of such data. This data is later being used to create a well structured invoice with items purchased and customers&amp;rsquo; information.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already created invoice.py program that stores structured receipt to the order_details.txt (that was an in-class project), now I&amp;rsquo;m writing a reverse program order.</description>

      <description>Alert Website is still in the developing mode. Many features aren&amp;rsquo;t working/working properly yet. This is still a fresh idea that requires time to be realized.</description>
