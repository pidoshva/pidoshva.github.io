      <description>Just added an interractive resume to the &amp;ldquo;Resume&amp;rdquo; section of the website. When clicked, you will be transferred to geleus.io where I have set up a terminal-like interactive resume.
This was mainly done for fun and education purposes. Feel free to play around with it. Just note, that it is still in the development phase. I will be adding more info to it soon.</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m Alive! Life has been crazy these past couple of years. This post is intended to be an update on my current state of things. Also, I will try to be more consistent with managing my website—I know it has been abandoned for a while now.
Initially, this website was meant to be my personal space to share academic and personal projects. I always wanted to document, explain, and share my software for aesthetic and professional purposes.</description>

      <description>Getting back to working on my website. Just finised my general education section last block, so, now I can fully dive into it.
So far I&amp;rsquo;m planning on working more on my personal projects for the portfolio so that I have something to present when I apply for the real job. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking to dive deeper into databases, APIs and OS. Also, haven&amp;rsquo;t been using python for A WHILE, gotta refresh it.</description>
